# 2PlayerBattleAdventure

This is a 2-Player Turn-based text game made in C++
Each Player selects a warrior to fight for them. Every warrior has unique characteristics and Special Abilities.
If your warrior dies, you lose the game. 

I have used various OOPS concepts in C++ like Inheritance, Abstract Class, Virtual Methods, Function Overriding, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Pointers, etc. You can click on the Replit Link below to play the game or to chack out the code.
